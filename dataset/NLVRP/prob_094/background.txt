A regional distribution company operates from multiple warehouses to deliver goods to various retail stores. Each vehicle is assigned to a specific warehouse, has a limited cargo capacity, and must return to its originating warehouse after completing deliveries. Retail stores specify time intervals during which deliveries must occur, and each store requires a single visit. The company seeks optimal routes that respect vehicle load limits, ensure on-time arrivals at all locations, and minimize the total travel distance across all vehicles.
