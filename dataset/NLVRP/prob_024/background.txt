A regional courier service operates from a central hub to deliver urgent packages to businesses across a metropolitan area. Each delivery vehicle has a maximum cargo capacity, and every business must receive its shipment within a strict two-hour delivery window. Vehicles departing the hub must ensure that each stop is serviced after the earliest allowed arrival time but before the latest permissible start time. The company seeks routes that use the minimum number of vehicles required while reducing total driving time, ensuring no vehicle exceeds its load limit and all deliveries adhere to the specified time constraints. Routes must originate and terminate at the central hub.
