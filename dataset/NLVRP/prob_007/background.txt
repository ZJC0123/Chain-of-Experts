A medical supply distributor manages daily deliveries of essential products from a central hub to various healthcare facilities. Each vehicle has a maximum load capacity, and each facility requires a specific quantity of supplies. Deliveries must occur within strict time windows to align with the facilities' operational hours, and vehicles must return to the hub within a designated operating period. The distributor aims to design routes that respect both vehicle capacity constraints and delivery time requirements while minimizing total travel time. Late arrivals or exceeding vehicle capacities are not permitted.
