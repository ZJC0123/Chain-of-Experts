A regional distribution company manages multiple warehouses across different locations to serve customers requiring timely deliveries. Each vehicle must depart from and return to its assigned distribution center, cannot exceed its maximum cargo capacity, and must arrive at each customer location within their specified time availability window. Customers have fixed delivery quantities and service duration requirements. The objective is to design routes that cover all deliveries while respecting vehicle capacities, temporal constraints, and geographical depot assignments to minimize total transportation distance.
