A regional distribution company manages multiple warehouses across a wide geographic area and must coordinate daily deliveries to meet customer demands. Each customer has a specific time window during which deliveries must occur, and each order has a defined volume that cannot exceed vehicle capacity limits. Vehicles are stationed at different warehouses, and each route must originate from and return to its assigned warehouse. The company aims to optimize delivery schedules to ensure timely service while minimizing total transportation costs, adhering to vehicle load constraints, and respecting strict time availability requirements at customer locations.
