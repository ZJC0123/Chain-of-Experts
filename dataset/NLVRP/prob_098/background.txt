A regional distribution company manages goods delivery from multiple warehouses to various businesses across a wide geographic area. Each vehicle must depart from and return to its assigned warehouse, with strict limitations on maximum cargo weight per trip. Customer locations have specific time frames during which deliveries must occur, and each stop requires a fixed service duration for unloading. The operation requires coordinating routes across the warehouse network to ensure timely arrivals while respecting vehicle load capacities. Formulate the problem to optimize delivery efficiency by minimizing the total travel distance across all vehicles.
