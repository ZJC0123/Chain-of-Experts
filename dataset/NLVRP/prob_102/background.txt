A regional logistics company operates several distribution centers to serve customers requiring timely delivery of goods. Each customer has a specific time window during which deliveries must occur, and each vehicle has a limited cargo capacity. Vehicles must depart from and return to the same distribution center, ensuring deliveries are completed within the designated time frames and without exceeding vehicle load limits. The company seeks optimal route assignments to minimize total operational time, including travel and service durations, while adhering to all customer constraints.
