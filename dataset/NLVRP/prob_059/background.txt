A catering service provider prepares daily meals from a central kitchen and delivers them to various corporate offices. Each delivery vehicle has a maximum load capacity, and each office requires their meal delivery within a specific time window to align with lunch breaks. The company aims to design optimal delivery routes that respect both vehicle capacity limits and strict delivery time constraints. Routes must originate from and return to the central kitchen. Formulate the problem to minimize the total travel distance while ensuring all deliveries are completed within the required time intervals and without exceeding vehicle load capacities.
