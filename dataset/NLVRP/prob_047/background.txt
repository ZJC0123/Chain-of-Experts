A medical supply company must distribute critical products from a central distribution center to various healthcare facilities across a region. Each vehicle has a maximum load capacity, and each facility requires a specific quantity of supplies that must be delivered within strict time windows. Deliveries cannot occur outside these time intervals, and vehicles must return to the distribution center by the end of the operating day. The company aims to design routes that serve all facilities while respecting both vehicle capacity constraints and delivery time requirements, minimizing the total travel distance across the fleet.
