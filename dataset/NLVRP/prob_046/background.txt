A pharmaceutical distributor must deliver time-sensitive medical supplies from a central warehouse to numerous healthcare facilities. Each delivery vehicle has a maximum weight capacity, and each facility requires receipt of supplies within strict time windows to align with operational hours. Deliveries must commence and conclude at the warehouse within a specified operating period. The distributor seeks optimal routes that adhere to vehicle load limits and ensure all deliveries occur within the designated time frames. Formulate the problem to minimize the total travel distance across all vehicles while satisfying capacity constraints and time-bound delivery requirements.
