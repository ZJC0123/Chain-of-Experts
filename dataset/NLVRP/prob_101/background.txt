A regional distribution company manages multiple facilities across a wide area to serve customers requiring timely deliveries. Each facility operates a fleet of vehicles with limited cargo capacities and maximum allowable travel times per route. Customers have specific time windows during which deliveries must occur, and each delivery requires a fixed service time at the location. The company aims to design routes where each vehicle departs from and returns to the same facility, fulfills all customer demands within their availability periods, and adheres to vehicle load limits. The objective is to minimize the total distance traveled across all routes while ensuring no violations of time constraints or capacity restrictions.
