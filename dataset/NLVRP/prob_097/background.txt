A regional distribution company manages multiple warehouses and needs to coordinate deliveries to numerous retail stores. Each store has a specific time window during which deliveries must occur, and each vehicle has a maximum load capacity. The company aims to assign vehicles to warehouses and design routes that ensure timely deliveries while respecting vehicle capacities. All routes must originate and terminate at their assigned warehouse, and the total travel distance across all routes should be minimized.
