A national logistics company manages multiple distribution centers to serve retail stores across a wide geographic area. Each store requires daily replenishment of goods within strict delivery time frames. Vehicles have maximum load capacities and permissible route durations to ensure driver schedules comply with regulations. Routes must originate from and return to the same distribution center, with each store receiving exactly one delivery. Service at each store must begin within predefined time intervals to avoid operational disruptions. The company aims to design cost-effective routes that respect vehicle constraints, time availability, and depot assignments.
