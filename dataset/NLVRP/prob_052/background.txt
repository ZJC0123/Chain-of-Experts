A catering company prepares daily meals at a central kitchen and delivers them to various corporate offices across the city. Each office specifies a strict time window during which meals must arrive to coincide with lunch hours. Delivery vehicles have a maximum load capacity to ensure meals remain fresh and are transported safely. The company seeks optimal routes that respect both vehicle capacity limits and delivery time constraints, ensuring all customers receive their orders within the required intervals. Routes must originate from and return to the central kitchen. Formulate the problem to minimize the total travel distance while adhering to all capacity and time window restrictions.
