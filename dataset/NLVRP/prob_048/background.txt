A medical supply company manages deliveries of essential products from a central distribution center to various healthcare facilities. Each vehicle has a maximum load capacity, and each facility requires a specific quantity of supplies. Deliveries must occur within strict time windows to ensure availability for patient care. Vehicles departing the distribution center must complete their routes within the facility's operating hours. Arriving earlier than a facility's designated time results in waiting, while late arrivals are not permitted. The objective is to design routes that serve all facilities within their required time frames, respect vehicle capacities, and minimize the total travel time across all vehicles.
