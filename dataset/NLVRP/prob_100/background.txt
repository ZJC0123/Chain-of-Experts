A national retail chain operates several regional distribution centers to supply products to stores across different areas. Each store requires deliveries within specific time windows, and each vehicle has a maximum cargo capacity. Routes must start and end at the same distribution center, ensuring timely arrivals while respecting vehicle load limits. The company seeks optimal routes that fulfill all delivery requirements, adhere to time constraints, and minimize total travel distance across the fleet.
