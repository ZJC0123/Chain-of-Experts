    "VARIABLES": "Let \( x_i \) be a binary variable where \( x_i = 1 \) if cell tower is built at location \( i \), and \( x_i = 0 \) otherwise, for all potential locations \( i \in I \). Let \( p_j \) represent the population in region \( j \), for all regions \( j \in J \). Let \( d_{ij} \) be a binary variable where \( d_{ij} = 1 \) if cell tower at location \( i \) provides coverage to region \( j \), and \( d_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise, for all potential locations \( i \in I \) and regions \( j \in J \). Let \( C \) be the maximum number of cell towers that can be built.",
    "CONSTRAINS": "1. The total number of cell towers built cannot exceed the budget constraint: \\[ \sum_{i \in I} x_i \leq C \\]
2. Each region's coverage is determined by at least one cell tower within its range: For each region \( j \in J \), there must be at least one location \( i \) such that a cell tower provides coverage to the region, and this can only happen if a cell tower is built at that location: \\[ \sum_{i \in I} d_{ij} \geq 1 - (1 - x_i) \quad \forall j \in J \\]
3. The binary nature of \( x_i \): \\[ x_i \in \{0, 1\} \quad \forall i \in I \\]
4. The binary nature of \( d_{ij} \): \\[ d_{ij} \in \{0, 1\} \quad \forall i \in I, j \in J \\]",
    "OBJECTIVE": "Maximize the total population covered: \\[ \max \sum_{j \in J} p_j \sum_{i \in I} d_{ij} x_i \\]"
}
```

This model ensures that the number of cell towers built does not exceed the budget constraint, each region is covered by at least one cell tower if possible, and it maximizes the population coverage.
